![Band Name Generator](/assets/images/band_name.jpg)


Prograp is a simple web-based application that generates a band name by combining the city you grew up in and your pet's name. This project uses **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend to create a user-friendly, interactive band name generator.

## Features

- **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.
- **Band Name Generation**: After the user submits the form, the application combines both inputs to generate a band name.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled using CSS and is responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Flask Backend**: Flask is used to handle the form submission and render the generated band name dynamically.
